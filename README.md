# Keyboard Tester
## Description
This is a simple keyboard checker util. When you run the program it will place you in a new terminal window that allows you to press any key to verify that it is working. This is mainly intended for when you are building a mechanical keyboard and want to verify that all of the switches are working properly.
## Installation
To use it simply download the .cpp file and compile it using the g++ command line utility.

`g++ main.cpp -lncurses`

Then from there run the compiled code. 

`./a.out`

NOTE: You will need to install ncurses in order to compile the program.
